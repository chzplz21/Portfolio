<p style = "font-size: 50px">

For this project, I first wanted to learn how to slide in the text and make it fade in. I found out most of this info on w3 schools.
It wasn't too difficult, it just required learning the "animate" feature of CSS which took about an hour to figure out.

I also wanted to  take screen shots of some of the web sites I've made and have them in small boxes that you could click on in the 
portfolio page. This was easy enough after downloading a Chrome extension which took screenshots.

<br>
Then, for the image map, I just realized that the best thing to do was have a picture of the three core front-end technologies
and make them clickable via an image map.

Thanks!
